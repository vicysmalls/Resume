            <h3>Junior Design Autonomous Vehicle Final Project, Tufts University</h3>       Jan 2024 - May 2024<br />
            <ul>
            <li> Coded a robot car with Arduino C++ to sense obstacles in front of it using an IR light collision 
                system on an Arduino UNO WiFi Rev2</li>
            <li> Programmed a robot car to follow a predetermined route across a red, blue, and yellow colored 
                road using state machines</li>
            <li> Controlled the motors of a robot with OOP so that the direction, speed, and turning of the robot 
                could be controlled with class functions</li>
            </ul>
